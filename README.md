# CubeSat Passive Attitude Stabilisation
Simulator in development to evaluate stability and dynamics of Earth-orbiting CubeSat with moveable aft solar panels.

### Currently contains: 
- Definition of CubeSat geometry, creating satellite object
- Calculation of CubeSat inertia
- Simulation of particles impacting CubeSat, generated by projecting its shadow on the plane normal to incoming particles
- Propagation of CubeSat attitude in time

### Roadmap
- [ ] Varying types of particle interactions beyond basic momentum exchange
- [ ] Adding orbital mechanics to automatically vary location of incoming particles
- [ ] Enable satellite/simulation settings to be loaded from (custom) settings files
  - [ ] File defining satellite geometry
  - [ ] File defining satellite mass and inertia properties
  - [ ] File defining simulation 
- [ ] Add ability to implement control systems, e.g.
  - [ ] Control system manipulating angles of individual panels, like airbrakes
  - [ ] Internal active attitude control (reaction wheels?)
